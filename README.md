# Lars-2.0

Lars-2.0 is a Windows-compatible VST3 plugin and standalone application designed for music drum demixing: it intelligently separates drum tracks from the rest of a song, making remixing, production, sampling, and musical practice easier.

## üéµ Description

Lars-2.0 leverages advanced audio processing and machine learning techniques to extract drum components from music tracks. It is intended for producers, musicians, DJs, and researchers who want to easily isolate drums, either as a VST3 plugin or a desktop application.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- **Operating system:** Windows (tested on Windows 11)
- **Compatible DAWs:** (for VST3, e.g., Ableton Live, FL Studio, Reaper, etc.)
- **Dependencies:**
  - CMake ‚â• 3.30.3 (tested with 3.30.3 and 3.31.6)
  - Additional libraries: libtorch 2.6.0+cpu

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

First, download libtorch (CPU distribution, release version):  
https://download.pytorch.org/libtorch/cpu/libtorch-win-shared-with-deps-2.6.0%2Bcpu.zip

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FranciscoMessina00/Lars-2.0.git
cd Lars-2.0
cmake -S . -B build
```

### Build (VST3/Standalone)

- Before compiling the Visual Studio solution, ensure that the libtorch library is inside the `libs` directory.
- Compile the desired format in Release mode.
- After the build, the VST3 plugin and standalone software will be in `.\build\plugin\SlothPlugin_artefacts\Release`.
- Move the VST3 folder to `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3` and the Standalone directory to your preferred location.

To make the VST3 work properly, libtorch's DLLs must be placed inside the `System32` folder, or the path to `.\libtorch\lib\` must be added to the system's global PATH environment variable. We acknowledge this is not the ideal installation process, but currently, it is the only way we have managed to get the VST3 working on Windows. There does not seem to be an easy solution for making libtorch work with the VST3 format. For more details, do not hesitate to contact us.

We are planning to develop an installer to make the installation process simpler and faster.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

- **VST3 Plugin:** Load "Lars-2.0" as an audio effect in your favorite DAW, load a track, and adjust the demixing parameters.
- **Standalone:** Launch the application, load the audio file, and start the drum demixing process. Export the separated tracks when finished.

## ‚öôÔ∏è UI and Functions

- Load an audio track in WAV, FLAC, or MP3 format in the upper section of the device by drag-and-drop or by clicking the upload button. The output files will be in WAV format. Two waveforms will be displayed: green for the left channel and red for the right channel.
- Press the play/stop button to play or pause the audio file you uploaded.
- Drag the transport bar to navigate through the file. Click anywhere on the waveform to jump to that point, or double-click to jump to the beginning of the file. Playback will automatically loop when the transport bar reaches the end of the file.
- Press the divide button to start audio separation. You can still listen to and navigate the file during the separation process.
- When the process is finished, the separated tracks will be loaded in the bottom part of the device. The same transport controls are available for the visualized separated track. To change the displayed track, press one of the available track buttons.
- You can save the separated files by dragging one of the track buttons to your desired location (even directly into an audio track in your DAW), or you can save all tracks in a single location by pressing the download button.
- You can switch the separation model by using the drop-down menu. For more details about the separation models, please refer to the attached file.
